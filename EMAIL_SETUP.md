## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "Authentication Failed"
- Verify `EMAIL_USERNAME` is correct
- Ensure `EMAIL_PASSWORD` is an app password, not your regular password
- For Gmail, confirm 2FA is enabled and app password is generated

#### "Connection Timeout"
- Check SMTP server address and port
- Some networks block SMTP ports - try different network

#### "No Email Received"
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` address is correct
- Check GitHub Actions logs for email sending errors

### Email Provider Specific:

#### Gmail
- Must use app passwords (requires 2FA)
- Regular passwords won't work
- App password format: 16 characters without spaces

#### Corporate Email
- May require different SMTP settings
- Contact IT department for SMTP server details
- May need VPN or specific network access

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials** to the repository
2. **Use app passwords** instead of regular passwords
3. **Rotate secrets** periodically
4. **Limit repository access** to trusted users
5. **Monitor email notifications** for unauthorized access

## üìã Example Secret Values

```
EMAIL_USERNAME: myaccount@gmail.com
